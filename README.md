# Welcome to my profile.
I'm currently a student at Whatcom Community College.

In general, I'm mostly a Python developer, but due to school
I've taken up a lot more Java programming. That said, I like to dabble in any language that seems relevant to a project I'm working on.

I've been using computers since I was three, and I've been coding since I was 13.

My pinned repos are the repos I believe best reflect my coding abilities, and most of them, my ability to write code collaboratively.
